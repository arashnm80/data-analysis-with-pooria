1. change min and max calculation method to deque mode which is way faster
2. perform program on multiple inputs
3. perform program on limited range of input file
4. percentage is calculated twice (my idea: calculate percentage at the start of loop, pooria idea: calculate border of exit from upmargin and downmargin at the start of the loop)
